\section*{Interaction}
To begin the interaction, your program shall read two integer $N$ and $T$
($6 \leq N \leq 110, 1 \leq T \leq 6$), the number of cities and the current test group.

Afterwards you can start asking queries. 
For each query, you should write a line of the format \texttt{? A B} ($0 \le A, B \le N-1$),
and afterwards read an integer, which will contain the distance between cities $A$ and $B$.

When you have found an answer, you should write a line of the format \texttt{! R}, where \texttt{R}
is your answer.

It is guaranteed that the roads and settlements are constant and do not change in response to your queries.
